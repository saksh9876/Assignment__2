    "**Declaring and Assigning Values to Variables:**\n",

    "To declare and assign values to variables in Python, you simply need to choose a variable name and use the assignment operator `=` to assign a value to it. Here's the basic syntax:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assigning an integer value to a variable\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assigning a string value to a variable\n",

    "\n",
    "# Assigning a floating-point value to a variable\n",
    "price = 10.99\n",

    "You can use various types of values, including numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and more, to assign to variables. Python automatically determines the data type based on the value you assign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names must follow certain rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (`_`).\n",
    "- They must start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a digit.\n",
    "- They are case-sensitive (`myVariable` and `myvariable` are different variables).\n",

    "is_active = True\n",

    "x = 5       # x is an integer\n",
    "y = \"Hello\" # y is a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also reassign values to variables as needed:\n",

    "    In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type casting or type conversion. Type casting allows you to explicitly change the data type of a value from one type to another. Here are some common type conversion functions and techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **int()**: Convert to Integer\n",
    "   Use the `int()` function to convert a value to an integer data type. This is useful when you have a float or a string representing an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   float_value = 10.5\n",
    "   int_value = int(float_value)  # Converts to integer, value becomes 10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **float()**: Convert to Float\n",
    "   The `float()` function converts a value to a floating-point number. This can be used to convert integers or strings to floating-point values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   int_value = 5\n",
    "   float_value = float(int_value)  # Converts to float, value becomes 5.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **str()**: Convert to String\n",
    "   The `str()` function converts a value to a string data type. This is useful for displaying values and creating formatted strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   integer_value = 42\n",
    "   string_value = str(integer_value)  # Converts to string, value becomes \"42\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **bool()**: Convert to Boolean\n",
    "   The `bool()` function can convert values to boolean values (`True` or `False`). This is useful when you want to check the truthiness or falsiness of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   zero_value = 0\n",
    "   bool_value = bool(zero_value)  # Converts to boolean, value becomes False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **list(), tuple(), set()**: Convert to Collection Types\n",
    "   You can convert values to different collection types like lists, tuples, and sets using the respective constructor functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   string_value = \"hello\"\n",
    "   list_value = list(string_value)  # Converts to list, value becomes ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Type Casting Operators**: Some type casting can be done using operators, such as converting an integer to a character (ASCII) using the `chr()` function or getting the integer value of a character using the `ord()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   char = 'A'\n",
    "   ascii_value = ord(char)  # Converts character to ASCII value, value becomes 65\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that not all type conversions are valid. For example, converting a string that is not a valid integer representation to an integer will raise a `ValueError`. It's important to ensure that the data is convertible to the desired type before attempting the conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, keep in mind that some conversions might result in loss of data or precision. For instance, converting a float to an integer will truncate the decimal part."
